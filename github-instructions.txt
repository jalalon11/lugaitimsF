# Instructions to Connect to Your New GitHub Account

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Log in to your other GitHub account
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "lugaitims")
   - Choose whether to make it public or private
   - Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the repository URL. It will look something like:
   https://github.com/your-username/lugaitims.git

3. Connect your local repository to the new GitHub repository by running these commands:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/lugaitims.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace "your-username" with your actual GitHub username.

4. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token if you have 2FA enabled).

Your code is now connected to your new GitHub account without any of the commit history from your previous GitHub account!
